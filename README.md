# Discord simple duckhunt (WIP)

A simple implementation of a fun duck hunt bot for Discord. Not yet functional. Uses [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).

Intended to be self-hosted rather than set up as a public discord bot.

Supports multiple servers.

Stats & leaderboard coming soon

Required env vars:

`DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Get this by creating a discord app and adding a bot user.
`FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`: Base64 encoded version of firebase serviceAccountKey.json (with cloud firestore enabled)
